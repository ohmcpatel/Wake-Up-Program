# Wake-Up-Program
Automated toothbrush tracker using OpenCV, runs at 6am, tracks toothbrush presence, if not detected posts an embarrassing pic on Instagram as reminder to brush teeth.

The project I developed in Python is an automated toothbrush tracker using computer vision and OpenCV. The system is designed to run automatically every morning at 6 am. The project uses OpenCV's computer vision capabilities to track the presence of a toothbrush within the frame of a camera.

The system captures the video feed from the camera and uses OpenCV's object detection techniques to detect the toothbrush in the frame. If the toothbrush is not detected within a certain time frame, the system will then use Selenium to automatically open up Instagram and post an embarrassing picture of the user as a reminder to brush their teeth.

In order to achieve this functionality, the system employs several key technologies. Firstly, the project uses OpenCV's computer vision libraries for object detection and image processing. In addition, the system also utilizes Selenium, a web scraping and automation library, to interact with the Instagram website and post the embarrassing picture.

The project is a highly customizable, it can be set to different time and image to post. The project uses a combination of Python scripting and computer vision techniques to create a unique and innovative solution for promoting oral hygiene. It could be used in a home or office setting to remind people to brush their teeth and prevent tooth decay and other oral health issues.
